## App's name:

Family Tree Application.
The website allows users to create a family tree consisting of a group of members (“Grandparents", "Parents", "Son", "Daughter"). If the user is a member, he is allowed to view all existing trees, edit , and delete them. Members can also view all members within a single tree, edit their information, and delete them. However, if the user is not a member, they will only be able to view the available data.
